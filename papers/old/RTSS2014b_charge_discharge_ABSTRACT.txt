Electric vehicles (EVs) are usually powered by a large number of battery cells, necessitating an effective battery management system (BMS) which protects the battery cells from harsh conditions while providing the required power efficiently. The discharge/charge rate of battery cells affects their health significantly, and existing BMSes employ simple discharge/charge rate scheduling so as to prevent weak cells from being discharged/charged excessively.

In this paper, we design and evaluate the real-time management of battery discharge/charge rate to extend the life of batteries in powering EVs based on their physical dynamics and operation history. We first explore a contemporary energy storage system for EVs to capture its physical dynamics that affect the battery discharge/charge rate; for example, a regenerative braking system for reusing the dissipated energy leads to current surges into the batteries, which shortens battery life. Based on understanding of the effects of discharge/charge rate in an energy storage system, we first devise control knobs for manipulating the discharge/charge rate. Then, we design an adaptive algorithm
that manages the discharge/charge rate by determining the control knobs with a reconfigurable energy storage architecture. Our in-depth evaluation demonstrates that the proposed discharge/charge rate management improves battery life up to 37.7% at little additional cost compared to the existing energy storage systems.
