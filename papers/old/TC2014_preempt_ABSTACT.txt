The earliest-deadline-first (EDF) policy has been widely studied for the scheduling of real-time jobs for its effectiveness and simplicity. However, since each preemption incurs an additional delay to the execution of jobs, the effectiveness of EDF is affected greatly by the underlying preemption policy that determines if and when a higher-priority job is allowed to preempt a currently executing lowerpriority job. To address this problem, we propose a new and better (in meeting job deadlines) preemption policy of EDF, given a non-zero preemption delay. Specifically, we propose a controlled preemption (CP) policy that controls the condition of preempting jobs, whereas existing approaches focus on that of preempted jobs. We define cp-EDF in which the CP policy is applied to EDF, and analyze its schedulability. This schedulability analysis is then utilized to develop an algorithm that assigns the optimal control parameters of cp-EDF. Our in-depth evaluation has demonstrated that cp-EDF with the optimal parameter assignment improves EDF schedulability over existing preemption policies by up to 7.4%.
